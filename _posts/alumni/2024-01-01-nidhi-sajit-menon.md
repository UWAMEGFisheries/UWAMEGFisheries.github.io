## Big fish in a warming pond: increase in abundance of large-bodied fishery species within Sanctuary Zones and potential assemblage warming within a south-western Australian marine park (2024)

Assessing the effects of Marine Parks on local ecosystems is essential to better inform future conservation strategies. The Ngari Capes Marine Park (NCMP), situated in an ecologically significant region of south-western Australia, was zoned in 2019 by the Western Australian government’s Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) into general use, special purpose and “no-take” sanctuary zones, which dictate what type of activity is permitted within these zones. In the years following this zonation, regular monitoring has taken place using BRUVs or Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems that allow us to quantify fish assemblages, particularly large target species that may be susceptible to recreational and commercial fishing outside sanctuary zones. My Masters project aims to evaluate the differences between fish communities in fished and unfished areas of the NCMP over a six-year period, focusing on indicator species larger than the size of maturity or minimum legal size. Such efforts are vital to deepen our understanding of the benefits provided by Marine Parks to important ecosystems and improve marine spatial planning in the future.

## About Me
Growing up in the coastal city of Chennai, India, my first love has always been the ocean. Having decided at the age of 11 to become a marine biologist, I had several opportunities right at home to make a difference, ranging from volunteering with Olive Ridley turtle conservation groups to running a campaign that replaced plastic bags with recycled paper ones. Moving to Hong Kong in 2019 for my undergraduate degree in ecology and marine biology was an absolutely amazing experience. I got to participate in research involving corals, oysters, snails and more, jetted off on an exchange semester to Northeastern University in Boston, travelled to South Africa for a wonderful field course and finally ended with a thesis exploring the effects of marine heatwaves on sea urchins. I started my Masters degree at UWA in 2023, realising my years-long dream of studying marine biology in Australia! My time here has really helped me understand the kind of research I would like to undertake in the future, and I hope my Masters project is just the beginning. When I’m not at university, I enjoy weekend snorkels with my friends, attending concerts and musicals and travelling around Australia.
