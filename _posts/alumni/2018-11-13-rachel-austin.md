My main role for this lab is conducting fieldwork, BRUV and BOSS video analyses, species identification, and associated tasks

## About me
I completed my Bachelor's in Marine Science and Zoology in 2015, and my Master's in Marine Biology in 2017 at UWA. My thesis was investigating introduced and invasive fouling marine species in the Ngari Capes Marine Park. I have since obtained my Divemaster and Coxswain qualifications and I now work for Dr Tim Langlois and Professor Gary Kendrick at UWA providing field, lab and general research assistance. I have been involved in a wide range of projects involving fish biodiversity surveys, seagrass restoration, fish otolith aging, coral growth measurements, and working with traditional owners. I am also an underwater photographer with images published in a range of mediums.
