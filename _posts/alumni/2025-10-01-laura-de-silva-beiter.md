## Identifying Allometric Relationships in Whale Sharks (Rhincodon typus) Through Body Proportion Analysis to Improve Estimates of Body Size (2025)

This study aims to identify ontogenetic relationships between body size rations and fork length in whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) using accurate stereo-video (DOV) measurements. We aim to model these relationships as predictors of fork length through statistical analysis, which may provide the basis for application to 2D image databases. This would allow a whale shark's size to be estimate through 2D identification photographs, and may be applied to global databases to better understand population dynamics in whale sharks.
## About Me
I was born in Singapore, and am half German, so I lived in three different continents by the time I was six years old. However, it was living close to the beach in Perth since then that helped shape my passion for the marine world and conserving it. I completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Zoology at UWA in 2023, and am now completing my Masters in Marine Biology by coursework and dissertation at UWA. I love snorkelling and exploring the Western Australia coastline, especially along the Ningaloo Reef in Exmouth, and I have also had the pleasure of working in the marine eco-tourism industry during the annual humpback whale migrations.
