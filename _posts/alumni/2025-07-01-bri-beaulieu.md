## Role
<img src='/images/Beaulieu_profile_square.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">

My primary roles in the UWA Marine Ecology Group include video analysis on both tropical and temperate marine systems, conducting fieldwork deploying stereo-camera systems, and fish identification.

## About me

I grew up in Canada and completed my Honours Bachelors of Science in Biology at the University of Western Ontario. I conducted my undergraduate thesis work at the Queen's University Marine Laboratory in Portaferry, Ireland, where I specialized in the behavioural responses of blue mussels to various cues. I then travelled to Western Australia in 2022 to begin my Masters degree in marine biology at the University of Western Australia. I had the pleasure of collaborating with the Australian Institute of Marine Science and Dr. Mark Meekan to study scarring patterns of whale sharks at Ningaloo Marine Park for my dissertation. I now work in the UWA Marine Ecology Group Fisheries research lab as a research assistant for Dr. Tim Langlois.
