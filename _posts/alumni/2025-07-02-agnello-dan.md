## Role
<img src='/images/Agnello_profile_square.JPG' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My role within the lab is to conduct video analysis on both tropical and temperate marine assemblages, while also aiding in the preparation, calibration and deployment of BOSS and BRUV systems for fieldwork. 

## About me
I completed my Bachelor of Coastal & Marine Science at Curtin University in 2022. Through my experiences during my studies, fieldwork, internships and scholarships, I found a passion for research that led me to further my studies with a Masterâ€™s degree in Environmental Science at Curtin University. The focus of my research is on how fish behaviour (specifically wariness) influences temperate reef ROV surveys under different anthropogenic pressures and stimulus with the aim to improve how ROV surveys are conducted and what anthropogenic pressures may need to be accounted for during survey. I joined the UWA Marine Ecology Group research lab in 2023 as a Research Assistant for Dr. Tim Langlois.
