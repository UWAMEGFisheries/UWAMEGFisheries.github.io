Over the past few years we have been striving to improve our workflow for fish imagery annotation. We would like to introduce two initiatives that we have developed that will help to optimise your workflow:

<img src='/images/globalarchive-screen.png' align='centre' width="500" hspace="10" vspace="10">

**[GlobalArchive](https://globalarchive.org/)**, an online portal for archiving, sharing and synthesising fish imagery annotation 

and 

<img src='/images/checkem-screen.png' align='centre' width="500" hspace="10" vspace="10">

**[CheckEM](https://marine-ecology.shinyapps.io/CheckEM/)**, a web app to perform standard quality control checks on fish imagery annotation, exported from the [EventMeasure](https://www.seagis.com.au/event.html) software from SeaGIS.

**GlobalArchive** has been adopted by multiple management and research agencies in Australia as a repository and database for their fish imagery annotation (e.g. [Parks Australia](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/marine/) and the [National Environmental Science Program](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/)), to build towards making this data is **[Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/fair-principles/)**.

**GlobalArchive** has been used to conduct an [Australian synthesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X21000403?via%3Dihub) of baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV) producing two publications so far:

[studying the impact of human activity on fish body-size distribution](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13807) at a continental scale and 

[providing design principles for no-take marine reserves](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15635).

This synthesis is currently being expanded to other stereo-video methods including diver-based and ROV surveys.

**CheckEM** brings together all the quality control lessons learned from these synthesis projects. Using established life history and distribution information to check the reliability of fish image annotations globally. We recommended **CheckEM** should be used before uploading data to **GlobalArchive.** See [this video for a live demonstration of CheckEM](https://youtu.be/yJ0KNdkDgrw).

**GlobalArchive** has also been used to contribute data towards global studies on [shark abundance distribution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2519-y) and recognised as part of a Global Ocean Observing System [Best-practice](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13470) and [foundation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.737416/full) for observing marine life.

**GlobalArchive** is currently being [further developed to increase the availability of metadata records and open data](https://doi.org/10.47486/DP761) within it to both biodiversity (e.g. [AODN](https://portal.aodn.org.au/), [OBIS](https://obis.org/)) and environmental reporting portals (e.g. [NationalMap](https://nationalmap.gov.au/)) in partnership with the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/).

**GlobalArchive** is also collaborating closely with a newly federally funded (AUD$1 million) [Automated Fish Identification Project](https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/automated-fish-counting-system-to-benefit-ecology-fisheries-industry/), building on the unique way that GlobalArchive collates both annotation point data and summarises this data to the survey scale. 

**GlobalArchive** has been recognised to be a key part of the recently funded International Council for Science’s Special Committee on Oceanic Research funded CoNCENSUS project, made up of marine researchers from 24 nations: Advancing standardisation of COastal and Nearshore demersal fish visual CENSUS techniques. In particular for complementary [data visualisation](https://globalarchive.shinyapps.io/Visualiser/) and [imagery visualisation](https://globalarchive.shinyapps.io/FishNClips/) initiatives currently under development.

**We invite you to use** **CheckEM** to complement your data quality control measures and to **submit your data to** **GlobalArchive**. 

We would be grateful to receive your feedback on either initiatives, please [submit your feedback here](https://forms.gle/1sznGMN8BBHC4bTv6). 

Please find the how-to guides here for both [GlobalArchive](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/) and [CheckEM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1KVR5I8AGsZRJ4MXh9PogWZ6g4rwrhMoFXfgmACzXo/edit).
