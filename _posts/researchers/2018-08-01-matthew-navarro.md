## Research

I am a multi-disciplinary marine scientist interested in integrating ecological, economic, and social ways of thinking to help align marine management with the aspirations of communities and society. My focus is on applied research and has included a diverse range of topics including no-take marine reserves, shark depredation, the objectives of recreational fishing management and incorporation of local ecological knowledge into management. Recently I completed a national social and economic benchmark of the Australian Marine Parks for the National Environmental Sciences Program, Marine Biodiversity Hub.
