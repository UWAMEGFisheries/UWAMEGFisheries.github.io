Post-doctoral researcher focused on the Integrated Coastal and Sensing Technologies (ICoAST) and Advancing Predictions of Marine Heatwaves collaborations. 

## About me

I am a geoscientist interested in modelling, mapping and monitoring Earthâ€™s systems for sustainable management. My background spans remote sensing, machine learning, and geostatistics for the mining, agricultural, and marine industries and I am passionate about transforming complex data into meaningful narratives for decision-making. My current research focuses on developing new remote-sensing products to map the Western Australian coast and the fusion of thermal products to better predict marine heatwaves.
