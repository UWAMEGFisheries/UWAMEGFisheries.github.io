My work explores machine learning using acoustic and video data from sites around Australia, with applications in in ecosystem research, remote sensing and species identification, and environmental health prediction.

## About me

I am a biomedical and systems engineer turned data scientist. My PhD focussed on unsupervised machine learning, with applications in Medicare fraud detection. As I am also a passionate musician and scuba diver, turning my professional skills towards marine audio applications seemed like a perfect opportunity.
