## Research

<img class="philprofile" src='/images/square-fernanda-rolim-profile.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">

I am a Marine Ecologist dedicated to uncovering patterns in fish assemblage composition and dynamics, and to understanding how these patterns respond to climate change and conservation management.

## About me

I am originally from Brazil where most of my career has been developed. I graduated in Biological Sciences from São Paulo State University (UNESP), where I conducted research on elasmobranch morphology and life history traits. To better understand one of the major threats to fish — fisheries— I pursued a master’s project at the Fisheries Institute of Sao Paulo analyzing industrial fishing dynamics and the effects of marine protected area establishment on these activities.During my PhD, I returned to in situ studies to investigate the effects of protection on fish assemblages using Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Videos (stereo-BRUVs), a method not yet established in Brazil at the time. To strengthen my expertise in this technique, part of my PhD was conducted with the Marine Ecology Group at the University of Western Australia in Perth.
After completing my PhD, I worked as a consultant for the Brazilian federal government, contributing to analyses of the conservation status of marine fish species. I then completed a three-year postdoctoral fellowship at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), monitoring fish assemblages in a no-take reserve (Alcatrazes Wildlife Refuge) using stereo-BRUVs and underwater visual census.
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of São Paulo and a visiting researcher at the Marine Ecology Group at UWA, analyzing the effects of climate change on fish assemblages through a cross-shelf study in the subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere.
