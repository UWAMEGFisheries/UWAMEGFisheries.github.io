## Role
<img src='/images/nik_lieb.jpg' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My main role in the UWA Marine Ecology Group Fisheries research lab is the development ofÂ GlobalArchive.org 2.0, as well as some 3D visualisation work for research and science communication.

## About me
I grew up about 50/50 in Germany and New Zealand. After having spent much of my youth moving around, life took me to Perth, where I studied, completing a Bachelor of Science (Physics, Computer Science) and Honours (Computer Science) at UWA. After some years writing various application and embedded software in industry, I was drawn, by my life long love for the ocean, to my current role as a full stack web developer for the amazing and delightful UWA Marine Ecology Group, where I primarily work on the exciting future of FAIR marine observation data through GlobalArchive.org.
