## Research
I am a marine ecologist focused on understanding and managing the ecological impact of fisheries, particularly the impacts on species caught as by-catch. I have also the led research developing a new approach for beach safety, including mitigating shark-human interactions, which facilitates autonomous detection and alerts through aerial surveillance. I have experience and expertise in data analysis, designing experiments, conducting remote feildwork, diving for research, BRUVs, drones, ultrasonography, acoutic telemetry, surgery and animal handling techniques.
