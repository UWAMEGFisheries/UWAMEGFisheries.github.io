## Role
<img src='/images/ryan-simms.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My main roles in the UWA Marine Ecology Group research lab include video analysis, conducting fieldwork and fish identification.

## About me
I grew up in rural NSW and completed my Bachelor of Marine Biology at the University of Technology, Sydney. I went on to work with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on their Crown of Thorns Starfish control program. I was part of this project for 6 years, during which I was able to explore the length of the Great Barrier Reef and witness itâ€™s vastness and variety of marine flora and fauna. I moved to Perth in early 2024 in the hopes to discover what the Western coast of Australia had to offer. I had the pleasure of joining the Marine Ecology Group at UWA, where I now work as a research assistant analysing videos of underwater communities and assisting in fieldwork.
