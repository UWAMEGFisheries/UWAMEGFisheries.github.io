## Role
<img src='/images/jorgia-blanks.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My main roles in the UWA Marine Ecology Group research lab include video analysis and species identification, planning and conducting fieldwork, and media content creation.

## About me
I grew up in Adelaide before moving to Brisbane to complete a Bachelor of Science (Marine Science and Ecology) at the University of Queensland, while also working as a Divemaster in the South East Queensland region. In 2022, I joined the Crown of Thorns Starfish Control Program as a Senior Research Diver, which gave me the unique opportunity to dive and boat extensively throughout the southern Great Barrier Reef for two years. I relocated to Perth in 2024 to complete my Master of Marine Biology at UWA, and am now working as a research assistant for Dr Matthew Navarro in the Marine Ecology Group.
