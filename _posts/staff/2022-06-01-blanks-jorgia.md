## Role
<img src='/images/jorgia-blanks.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
I am a research assistant working across projects that link marine management with social-ecological science. Current projects include an assessment of how voluntary behaviour change in recreational fisheries can support sustainability, as well as how people understand, value, and interact with the Australian Marine Parks.

## About me
I grew up in Adelaide before moving to Brisbane to complete a Bachelor of Science (Marine Science and Ecology) at the University of Queensland, while also working as a Divemaster in the South East Queensland region. In 2022, I joined the Crown of Thorns Starfish Control Program as a Senior Research Diver, which gave me the unique opportunity to dive and boat extensively throughout the southern Great Barrier Reef for two years. I relocated to Perth in 2024 to complete my Master of Marine Biology at UWA, and am now working as a research assistant for Dr Matthew Navarro in the Marine Ecology Group.
