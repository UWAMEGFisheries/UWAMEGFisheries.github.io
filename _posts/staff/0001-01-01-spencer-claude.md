## Role
<img src='/images/square-claude-spencer.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My main roles in the UWA Marine Ecology Fisheries research lab include video analysis, conducting fieldwork and fish identification.

## About me
I grew up in Esperance and completed my Bachelor of Science in Marine Science at UWA in 2018. After finishing my undergraduate degree, I began my Masters degree in Marine Biology in 2019, under the supervision of [Dr. Tim Langlois](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/researchers/tim-langlois/), [Dr. Thomas Wernberg](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-wernberg), and [Nestor Bosch](https://marineecology.io//phd-students/nestor-bosch/). My research found that abundance was a more important predictor of the feeding rate of scraping parrotfishes than temperature in tropicalized reefs in Western Australia. I now work in the UWA Marine Ecology Group Fisheries research lab as a research assistant for Dr. Tim Langlois.
