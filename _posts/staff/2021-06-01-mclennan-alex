## Role
<img src='/images/McLennan_profile_square.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
As a research officer my duties include boat-based fieldwork deploying stereo-camera systems, training staff and collaborators in sampling techniques, and video annotation for fish and habitat assemblages.

## About me
Growing up in Perth, Australia itâ€™s natural to be attracted to the marine environment. I studied a Masters in Marine Biology at the University of Western Australia, completing it at the end of 2018. Since then, I have worked as a field technician and a data analyst in both the university and the NGO sector. I have experience in big data representing fisheries and the seafood industry, as well as multi-faceted live-aboard expeditions.
