## Role
<img src='/images/henry-evans-profile.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">

Currently I work on predictive models and maps of fish and habitat using recent BRUV data. I also help plan and prepare fieldwork and regularly head out on field trips to deploy BRUVs and drop camera systems. In the lab I’ve also worked on video annotation and fish/habitat identification, and marine user surveys.

## About me

I’m born and bred in Perth, WA, with the Indian Ocean as my playground. Most of my education and career have been at UWA, where I completed a Bachelor of Science (Marine Science & Environmental Science) in 2020 and a Master of Biological Science (Marine Biology) with Distinction in 2022. Since then I’ve worked as a research assistant at UWA for a handful of lab groups, and spent a year in a similar role at Murdoch University. I love being able to do a variety of work in the Marine Ecology Group, and especially enjoy fieldwork!
