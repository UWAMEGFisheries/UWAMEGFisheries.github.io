## Role
<img src='/images/square-rob-hoschke-profile.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
Exploring professional fishers’ local ecological knowledge of marine environments in Western Australia.

## About me
I completed my Bachelor of science in Geology and Marine Science at UWA in 2017. I then entered the workforce as a geologist, however my career was abruptly put on hold by the first of many COVID lockdowns and a broken leg. During this hiatus from work I decided to go back to uni and delve deeper into the world of Marine Science. I enrolled in a Master’s degree at UWA midway through 2020, and was easily persuaded by Dr Matthew Navarro to embark on a project exploring commercial fishers’ knowledge of the marine environment. I completed my Master’s in 2021, but my exploration of fishers’ knowledge is far from over. I am now working alongside the Marine Ecology Group to learn more about what our professional fishers’ know about the ocean.
